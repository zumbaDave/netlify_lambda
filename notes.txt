need to create configure file called netlify.toml
we won't be able to serve without having this file
   inside of if we put
     [build]
        functions = "lamba"

make a functions folder
inside of there, the name of the files have to be the same name as the function

once we code our function
in node, npm run lambda-serve
this will create lambda folder that has the functions in it

google search git oath registration then go to first link, then make a new application to get following
keys
    const API_CLIENT_ID = "668f2e8136976ce3a380";
    const API_CLIENT_SECRET = "9cc90584fd83a632206326f3c141634dfa113eee";
